    I am Leonardo Silveira, professionally working with technology since 2007 as

    Jira, Linear and Trello. I worked with top tier teams in Brazil and cross
    borders in near-shore companies. I produced solutions for several markets,
    like health and car insurance, closed gates community management,
    educational games, online presence for local business, country-wide retail
    solutions, world-class payment platform solutions and real state business
    intelligence solutions.

            Markerr sells market intelligence for real state investors. it
            refines big data from several sources and present them to the client
            via bulk reads and also via a tool called datastudio. I work on the
            ecosystem needed to run this tool: AWS EKS, MSK, RDS, S3 and so on.

            There is a variety of services, most of them written in Kotlin and
            SpringBoot, but there is also Node.js services and Go services.

            Those services are running inside 3 EKS clusters, completely
            integrated with a CI/CD pipeline written by me. 

            I am currently in charge of maintain and evolve all services and i
            plan to move most of them from jvm ecosystem to something more
            familiar to the rest of the team.
