# The new blog

It was time for change.

![the old blog](/assets/post-pics/0019-the-new-blog/old.png)

The fourth version of this place was intended to be also my experimentation
ground for my [vue](https://vuejs.org/) skills.

It was, however, a result of it's time. [browserify](http://browserify.org/) was
the bundler. While it stills a nice piece of software, it's ecosystem isn't rich
as the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is and the vue support is also better.

Also, it was not optimized.

The new blog/site uses an updated stack and es6 modules instead commonsJS.

And that's it.
