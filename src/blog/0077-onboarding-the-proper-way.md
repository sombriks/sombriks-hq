# How to proper onboard people in a team

It takes time, but not that much.

## Point a 'buddy'

Ask someone to help the new hire with questions, procedures and ceremonies. It's
cheap and also helps with team bonding. People that don't hate each other tends
to work better together.

## Respect the 'ramp-up'

No matter what is your product/project, people need **time** to proper
understand it. Respect that time. **Usually it's three months**. If your project
can't handle this time then it's not the moment to hire people.

## Keep hands-on documentation up to date

People will need to figure out how to build, run and test the product/project.
Keep good record of how to do those things and avoid the growth of
'tribal knowledge' in the company. It's not 'process over people' but respect to
people: the ones that know how to do the small things will grow weary of explain
again and again how to do something, so it's a good move to write down it.

## Conclusion

Team building can be tricky but it's necessary for a health product/project. But
pay attention on the moves you do when doing it so you don't harm the team.
