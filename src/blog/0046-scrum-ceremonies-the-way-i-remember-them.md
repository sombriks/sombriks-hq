# Scrum ceremonies the way i remember them

These are the ceremonies that are parte of the scrum agile methodology. I think.

## Sprint

It's a immutable period of time where things will happen.

It's very important to respect the boundaries of this time box. Otherwise
everything else becomes impossible to measure.

## Cards/Tasks/User stories

Piece of information describing the meaning of the work to be done.

A new system feature mostly.

Can count with other artifacts, a screen prototype or database scripts.
something else to help to make things happen.

## Team roles

Besides the developer/designer/dba roles, which are the roles that will execute
the tasks, a few other roles must exists:

### Scrum master

Responsible for schedule and conduct the ceremonies

### Product Owner

Responsible for create and accept tasks. Defines how the product should be. It's
common to say that he/she "owns" the product.

## Daily standup

The most important meeting. Everyone meet and talk about what is happening.

Sometimes there is an [ice breaker](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/icebreakers-scrum-alliance-masters-use-build-trust-teams),
but it's not that common.

Each person describes:

- What was done yesterday
- What is currently doing
- If there is any blocker

The daily standup is supposed to be fast, if something demands more attention,
they involved members can talk about it after the standup.

## Grooming

In this meeting the team talk about the tickets to be done. Try do guess how
long will it take to be done, if it makes sense, etc.

Depending on the team size, a technique called poker planning can be used to do
the estimates for each task.

## Showcase

In this meeting the team shows the progress of the current sprint. What was
already done and how is it working.

Usually it's shown for directors, sales team, etc.

## Retrospective

A meeting to talk about what went well, what went wrong and what could be
improved about the way the team works based on the previous sprint.

This is important because scrum isn't written in stone and must be adapted for
each team using it.

## Conclusion

For each of those topics there is a lot more, but you will identify at least
those ones in agile teams.

Happy Hacking.
