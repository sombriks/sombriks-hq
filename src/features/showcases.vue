      <a target="rbs" href="https://github.com/sombriks/rosetta-beer-store">This repository</a>
      contains a few sample codes to demonstrate how we can have interchangeable parts and technologies on modern web.</p>
    <p>(i was a little bored.)</p>

    <h2>GM Sample Worklog</h2>
    <p>A smaller yet focused
      <a target="gm" href="https://github.com/sombriks/gm-sample-worklog">tech showcase</a> putting
      <a target="sb" href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">spring boot</a>
      and companions (data-jpa, test, cache and so on) on the road. The java enterpreise indeed still have a few nice tricks in their pockets.</p>

    <h2>Yet another 2048</h2>
    <p>
      Back in time i found
      <a target="2048" href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">this game</a> and i was amazed. Simple, challenging, casual, fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made
      <a target="2048" href="https://github.com/sombriks/yet-another-2048">this version</a> just for fun, in the spare time, at saturday/sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It uses
      <a target="pixi" href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js">pixi.js</a> for drawing and
      <a target="hammer" href="https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer.js">hammer.js</a> for swipe detection.</p>

    <h2>The HelloJs initiative</h2>
    <p><i>Update: </i>the <a target="hjs5" href="https://github.com/sombriks/hello-js-v5">5th edition</a> 
      was offered as an extension course by <a target="fanor" href="https://www.devrybrasil.edu.br/fanor/cursos/extensao/tecnologia/javascript-fullstack">DeVry-Fanor</a> in 2018</p>
    <p>Back in 2015 i had the need of trained people. Our solution stack was knex, express, angularjs and cordova back then.</p>
    <p>So, instead just announce positions,
      <a target="yp" href="https://github.com/yuriploc">@yuriploc</a>
      and i set up a fullstack crash course and called it
      <a target="hj" href="https://github.com/seita-ifce/hello-js-v3">HelloJS</a>.</p>
    <p>The
      <a target="ifce" href="http://ifce.edu.br/">IFCE</a> technology students where our main audience and, as expected, i found among them some good team members.</p>
    <p>I think that the nicest part on this kind of interview is the chance to know a bit more about behavior instead just skills.</p>
    <p>Also, the ones we didn't pick up got a full stack crash course, so they didn't wasted their time at all.</p>
    <p>I advertised it on facebook
      <a target="hjs3a" href="https://www.facebook.com/sombriks/media_set?set=a.1408480285899693.1073741883.100002132055657&type=3">there</a> and
      <a target="hjs3b" href="https://www.facebook.com/sombriks/media_set?set=a.1493013440779710.1073741885.100002132055657&type=3">there</a>.</p>
