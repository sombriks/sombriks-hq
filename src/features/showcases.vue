    <h2>Yet another 2048</h2>
    <p>
      Back in time i found <a target="2048" href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">this game</a> and i was amazed. Simple, challenging, casual, fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made <a target="2048" href="https://github.com/sombriks/yet-another-2048">this version</a> just for fun, in the spare time, at saturday/sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It uses <a target="pixi" href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js">pixi.js</a> for drawing 
      and <a target="hammer" href="https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer.js">hammer.js</a> for swipe detection.</p>
