# How to structure a java project

It seems easy, but there is a reason people tend to use
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)'s for everything.

## In the beginning

In [the time before the time itself](https://history-computer.com/computers-in-the-1980s/),
there was the shell command prompt and the memory. And sometimes there was
[the current directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_structure).

So in order to use computer to do some work you had to issue commands in the
shell that could affect or not the contents inside a directory.

A compiler is a program that transforms source code into a program.

Usually that source code is available in the current directory.

## Make a folder, put stuff inside

So the first java project is nothing more than a folder with some code inside:

```bash
mkdir java-project-1
cd java-project-1
```
