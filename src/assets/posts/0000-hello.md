# First post

This is a test to make sure it can be dynamic.

- we have listings!
  - and sub-listings!

We have _italic_ **bold** and [links](https://github.com/chjj/marked)

There are of course code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("we are the champions")
const x = a => b => b(a)
```

```html
<div>Indeed</div>
```

**TODO** figure out why it got zero coloring on languages

We have inline images too!
