# Real-time communications with Socket.io

You see, most of the internet is built around the request/response abstraction.

But there is also other nice philosophies like pub/sub. Google it if you never
heard about it, trust me it worths the shot.

One of major benefits of pub/sub is the active role publishers have. On
request/response paradigm, the server only answers when someone asks for
something (a page, image, etc). Publishers on the other hand know who is
interested in a certain topic and send updates to these subscribers whenever new
content arrives at the topic.

On this post we'll make a small ~~chat app~~ _game_ to demonstrate how to use
the [socket.io](https://socket.io) node library.

## The server side

It's a simple npm project, see the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "sample-rtc-socket-io-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "sample project showcasing real time communication with socket.io",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^1.18.10"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "socket.io": "^2.2.0"
  }
}
```

### Topics and events

On socket.io idiom uses two concepts which represents the idea of the topic in
the pub/sub architecture where subscribers can join and observe.

The first one is the [namespace](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/master/docs/API.md#namespace).

Every client will connect into the root ("/") namespace.

The second one is the [room](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/master/docs/API.md#namespacetoroom).

Then everything becomes an emit/observe game. Either someone is emitting an
event or listening to it.

## The client side

It's a simple npm project generated by vue-cli tool. See the `package.json`:
