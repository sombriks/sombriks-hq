# Good enough UI on reactive framework era

As [promised](#/0007-vue-and-react-side-by-side.md) before here comes another
comparative article to advise you about vue and react ecosystem regarding CSS
toolkits. This is quite opinionated so buckle up and keep your critic sense
online.

## So what's the big deal about CSS toolkits

The web is built by HTML, CSS and Javascript maybe consuming some remote service
written in PHP and sometimes, by accident, any other language.

And _The Real World(TM)_ has something called deadlines.

In order to keep projects and dream on schedule, every work must be optimized
and the sweet reinvention of the wheel shall be avoided.

One way to do that is to use the nice work that other people cared enough to
share with the world.

And scripts and styles to make beautiful user interfaces are good to reuse
because this is what your customer will touch first.

You may need of course to study how to correctly use such jewels, but often it
worths the challenge. Mostly.

## Who are the big ones in this ecosystem

[Well](https://stackshare.io/stackups/bootstrap-vs-material-design-vs-semantic-ui),
there is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
[Material Design](https://material.io/design/) [and](https://bulma.io/)
[then](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
[some](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/index.html)
[others](https://semantic-ui.com/), but in this post we'll dive into Material
Design world.

## How many material frameworks are there

This is a tricky question since every day a new javascript framework is born.
But a simple search delivers the following results:

### Vue

- [vue-material](https://vuematerial.io/)
- [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
- [muse-ui](https://muse-ui.org)

Other results omitted, just not worthy

### React

- [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)
- [mui](https://www.muicss.com/docs/v1/react/introduction)
- [react-mdl](https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/)

Other results omitted, either bootstrap or trying to sell support

## Let's see some action, but first

First let's define what we need to produce so we can be fair.
